# Tor Documentation
This service can be accessed over [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) networks.

After the Docker container for Tor proxy (`tor`) was started successfully, the content of `secrets/tor/hidden_service/hostname` shows the `.onion` hostname like `yjqictkblqijcsldpwvkd2addy2kc7edpffeg64lhynruy3kxl7s5zid.onion`. Now you can access the service over Tor at the address you got.
